Talk: &ldquo;Interactive graphics for high-dimensional genetic data&rdquo;
----------------------------------------------------------------------

See it in action [here](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/talks/InteractiveGraphs2).

These are slides for a talk I gave at the ENAR meeting in Orlando,
Florida, on 13 March 2013.

The slides were tested for Safari on a Mac and might look terrible in
some browsers. I have a lot more to learn about handling browser
differences.
